Problem asked by Air BNB at their interview.

A solution to the problem of finding the maximum sum of all the non-adjacent number from a list of integer,
using a dynamic programming approach.

Example:

[2, 4, 6, 2, 5] -> Max non adjacent sum: 2+6+5 = 13
[5, 1, 1, 5] -> Max non adjacent sum: 5+5 = 10 
Etc..
