Problem asked by Amazon at their interview.

A simple solution to the problem of the run-length encoding and decoding, a fast method to encode strings.
The basic idea is to represent successive characters as single count of the occurrence of that
character, and the character itself.

Both encode and decode run in O(n).
Implemented in Java and C.

Example: "AAAABBBCCD" should be encoded as: "4A3B2C1B".
