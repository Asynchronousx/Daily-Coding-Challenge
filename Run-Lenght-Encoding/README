Problem asked by Amazon at their interview.

A simple solution to the problem of the run-length encoding and decoding, a fast method to encode strings.
The basic idea is to represent successive characters as single count of the occurrence of that
character, and the character itself.

Example: "AAAABBBCCD" should be encoded as: "4A3B2C1B".
