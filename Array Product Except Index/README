Problem asked by Uber at their interview.

A solution to the problem of an array of integers that, taken in input and analized, create 
a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers 
in the original array except i itself. Spice up: Don't use divisions.

Without the approach of the divisions, this problem was solved using recursion and trying to stay 
within the O(N) time complexity, with O(1) space complexity because the change is made in-place.
