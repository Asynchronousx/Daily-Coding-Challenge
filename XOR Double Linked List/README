Problem asked by Google at their interview.

A solution to the implementation of a XOR Double Linked List: 

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding 
next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the 
previous node. 
It has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns 
the node at index, both running in O(N) time complexity.
