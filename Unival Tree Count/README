Problem asked by Google at their interview.

A solution to the problem of finding the unival tree node count.
An unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

       0
      / \
 uni 1   0
        / \
  uni  1   0 uni 
      / \
 uni 1   1 uni 

The solution is found in O(N) time complexity, needed to analyze all the nodes.
