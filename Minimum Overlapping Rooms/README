This problem was asked by Snapchat at their interview.

A solution to the problem of given a list of intervals with start and end time of 
classroom lectures (possibly overlapping) find the minimum rooms of rooms required.

For example, given an interval list: [(30,75), (0,50), (60,150)] the function should return 2.
That's because:

             |     
1st interval |-------------| First room
2nd interval |       |---------------| Second room
3rd interval |                 |---------------------| First room (because 0-50 finished) 
             |________________________________________   
             0      30    50  60    75              150     Total: 2 rooms
             
             
The solution if found in O(N) linear time with a space complexity of O(N), because we memorize
an additional queue to take track in a FIFO behaviour of the end intervals.
