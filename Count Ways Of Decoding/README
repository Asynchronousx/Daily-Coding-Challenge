Problem asked by Facebook at their interview.

A solution to the problem of: Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, 
count the number of ways it can be decoded.
For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
This problem is solved in O(N) using a loop to the size of the string.
