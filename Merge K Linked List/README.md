This problem was asked by Google at their interview.

A solution to the problem of, given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists into one<br>
sorted singly linked list.

For example, given<br>
[1] -> [4] -> [9]<br>
[1] -> [2] -> [3]<br>
[5] -> [8] -> [14]<br>

the result is: <br>
[1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] -> [8] -> [9] -> [14].

The problem was solved utilizing a custom implementation of a linked list, with his dedicated sorting algorithm that works in O(N)<br>
in the average case, and O(N^2) in the worst scenario.
